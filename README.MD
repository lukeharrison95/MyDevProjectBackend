# Darts Buddy - Project 1



## My Project

We were assigned to make an OOP-based application that includes a minimum of two relatable databases and has full CRUD functionallity. The Application I have decided to make was Darts Buddy, a darts team managing Application. Darts buddy would help any captain manage his team by allowing him to add,edit and delete players from his team. The second database is the games the players play, you can add the games each player plays and darts buddy will put them into a league table, calculating points for each player and displaying them in this league table.
